ReadEncoders()

 

If Reverser in Neutral - place 0 in globals and return;

 

Read one encoders raw value into local var.

Change the select line for the other encoder next time through

(i.e. select line gets time to settle between calls to this routine)

Use locals as pointers into the 256 byte table - retrieve values

 

into local arrays of say 9 values?

Calculate rolling median

(Need that sort and swap code)

 

Set Throt or Dyn global before returning

 

__________________________________________

 

Routine to work out notch 'centrelines' - and include several

values each side as each notch.

Need a table that sets all these to the notch value

so say a 127, or a 53 returns notch '2' for both as it were.
