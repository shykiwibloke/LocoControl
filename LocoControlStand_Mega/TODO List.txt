TODO List for LocoControl Revision


1) Alter GetDynamic and GetThrottle so they return the notch read.
2) Create new routine EvaluateLevers() that looks at both Throttle and Dynamic at the same time to get accurate assessment based on history
3) Create variables to hold previous assessment(s) of notch/brake/mode etc
4) Create variables to hold new/recommended assessments of notch/brake/mode etc
5) Rewrite EvaluateState() so it does exactly that - focus on state only. (based on previous assessment and recommendations)

Amperage Calculation
1) Try this experiment:- modify so takes X samples of same motor quickly and focus on getting that right
   - anything learnt goes into the final routine design.
2) Try the grab 'peak' and multiply by the throttle %
3) Try assessing majority of readings as positive or negative in determining sign
