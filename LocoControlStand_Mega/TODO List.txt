TODO List for LocoControl Revision

1) TEST - Throttle not working in reverse when in dynamic mode
2) Stop acceleration if throttle closed b4 speed reached - takes 18 seconds to get to full throttle from idle
3) Send message to display for Dynamic Mode warning light and motors enabled



Amperage Calculation
PENDING response from Motor Controller Manufacturer on potential bug in driver

1) Try the grab 'peak+' & 'peak-' and determine which is most likey depending on controls and take at 0.707
2) Think about changing dynamic notches so 2 through seven are more than 1/16 apart 
    - an exponential scale so 7 = gradual stop OR setup notches 5-7 as auto decrement?
