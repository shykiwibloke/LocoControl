TODO List for LocoControl Revision

1) FIXED - Throttle not working in reverse when in dynamic mode
2) FIXED - Stop acceleration if throttle closed b4 speed reached - takes 18 seconds to get to full throttle from idle
3) DONE - every 15 seconds - Find a way to send occaisonal refreshes to raspi of Dynamic and Motor Enabling switches


Amperage Calculation
PENDING response from Motor Controller Manufacturer on potential bug in driver

1) Try the grab 'peak+' & 'peak-' and determine which is most likey depending on controls and take at 0.707
2) Think about changing dynamic notches so 2 through seven are more than 1/16 apart 
    - an exponential scale so 7 = gradual stop OR setup notches 5-7 as auto decrement?
