TODO List for LocoControl Revision

1) FIXED - Throttle not working in reverse when in dynamic mode
2) FIXED - Stop acceleration if throttle closed b4 speed reached - takes 18 seconds to get to full throttle from idle
3) DONE - every 15 seconds - Find a way to send occaisonal refreshes to raspi of Dynamic and Motor Enabling switches


Amperage Calculation
CLOSED response from Motor Controller Manufacturer on potential bug in driver - NO USEFUL RESPONSE

1) Try the grab 'peak+' & 'peak-' and determine which is most likey depending on controls and take at 0.707
2) Think about changing dynamic notches so 2 through seven are more than fixed 1/16 apart 
    - an exponential scale so 7 = gradual stop OR setup notches 5-7 as auto decrement?
3) Look at shortening emergency motor ramping (trials)
4) Introduce Short ramping between idle and notch one only. 
Or lengthen ramping the higher the notch. 
Need better reaction time for nudging - new switch for 'shunt' mode? or disable dynamic changes things?

5) If Sound bugs continue - allocate specific channels 
   OR maintain a list of channels 'opened then closed' and do a garbage run on them every so often
6) With Motors Disabled, and Dynamic Enabled - a minus 32k error number can slip through the tests in Coast Code.
